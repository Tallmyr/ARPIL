# Archipelago for RetroPie Laucher

***This is currently unreleased. This is still under development. Look at Dev branches for progress.***

## What is this?

[Archipelago Multiworld Randomizer](https://archipelago.gg/), at this point still known as Berserker MultiWorld Randomizer, is an ALttP-Randomizer tool. ([Source Code](https://github.com/Berserker66/MultiWorld-Utilities))
This is a script for [RetroPie](https://retropie.org.uk/) to make it easier to install and run Archipelago directly on this platform.

## How to install?

1. Download arpil.sh from releases or from source (in source, it's under scriptmodules/ports/) and copy to the ports scriptmodules folder on RPI: 
*~/RetroPie-Setup/scriptmodules/ports*
2. Copy your A Link to the Past v1.0 Japan ROM to  *romdir*/ports/Archipelago/
3. Run RetroPie Setup and install the ARPIL package found under "ext".

## (not so) FAQ

**Why isn't this part of RetroPie nativelly?**

Firstly, it's still unreleased, but more importantly, I haven't bothered to make it according to their standards.

**Does this support Multiworld, or just single player?**

First release is single player games only. Automating joining of Multiworld games are planned for later releases

**Can't I just use the Archipelago website and copy the roms over?**

Of course you can. I wanted something more convinient, and more importantly, I was bored.
